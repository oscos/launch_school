# Intro To Ruby

### [The Basics](https://launchschool.com/books/ruby/read/basics#strings)
```This chapter covered the basic building blocks of the Ruby language. You learned some basic data types and how to combine those types with operators. You also learned about data structures and how to use those structures to hold and access data```

* [p vs puts vs print?](https://launchschool.com/books/ruby/read/basics#nil)
* [What is nil?](https://launchschool.com/books/ruby/read/basics#nil)
* [What is modulos?](https://launchschool.com/books/ruby/read/basics#divisionvsmodulus)
* [Types of Data Structures?](https://launchschool.com/books/ruby/read/basics#basicdatastructures)
* [See Exercise 5](https://launchschool.com/books/ruby/read/basics#exercises)

### Variable
```In this chapter, we talked about how to use variables to store information for later use and how to get information from a user. We also showed that not all variables are created equal and that the scope in which a variable is defined changes its availability throughout the program```
* [Describe Variable Scope](https://launchschool.com/books/ruby/read/variables#variablescope)
* [Inner scope can access variables initialized in an outer scope, but not vice versa.](jekyll/contact-form-jekyll.md)
* [Type of Variables](https://launchschool.com/books/ruby/read/variables#typesofvariables)

### Methods
```Methods are a major part of programming in Ruby. Knowing what a method is and what operations it is performing is crucial to your development as a Ruby programmer. You'll be using them constantly, in programs both big and small. Knowing the difference between puts and return will help you avoid a common pitfall that we see many beginners struggle with. Finally, knowing how and when to use method chaining will help you better read code and let you write more succinct code. But watch out for those nils.```
* [What are methods?](https://launchschool.com/books/ruby/read/methods#whataremethodsandwhydoweneedthem)
* What is method invocation
* Diff: method invocation with a block vs method definition
* [obj.method or method(obj)](https://launchschool.com/books/ruby/read/methods#objmethodormethodobj)
* [Describe Mutating the Caller](https://launchschool.com/books/ruby/read/methods#mutatingthecaller)
* [Diff: puts vs return](https://launchschool.com/books/ruby/read/methods#putsvsreturnthesequel)
* [Methods as Arguments](https://launchschool.com/books/ruby/read/methods#methodsasarguments)
* Ruby methods ALWAYS return the evaluated result of the last line of the expression unless an explicit return comes before it.
* If you have experience programming in other languages and are wondering if Ruby is a pass-by-value or pass-by-reference language, then you might be disappointed with the answer. In a way, Ruby is both!
* Ruby methods ALWAYS return the evaluated result of the last line of the expression unless an explicit return comes before it.
* [See Exercise 4](https://launchschool.com/books/ruby/read/methods#exercises)

### Flow Control
```This chapter covered booleans, comparisons and the ability to control the flow of code execution with conditionals.```

* [Ternary Operator](https://launchschool.com/books/ruby/read/flow_control#ternaryoperator)
* [Type of Variables](https://launchschool.com/books/ruby/read/variables#typesofvariables)
* [Case Statement](https://launchschool.com/books/ruby/read/flow_control#casestatement)
* [See Exercise 4](https://launchschool.com/books/ruby/read/flow_control#exercises)

### Loops & Iterators
```Loops and iterators are a great way to perform repeated operations on a data set. Often, in Ruby, you'll find yourself reaching for an iterator before a loop, but not all the time. Recursion, the ability to call a method inside of itself, can also do some powerful operations when solving problems.```
* [Types of Loops](https://launchschool.com/books/ruby/read/loops_iterators#simpleloop)
* [Diff: Loop vs Iterator](https://launchschool.com/books/ruby/read/loops_iterators#iterators)
* [Recursion](https://launchschool.com/books/ruby/read/loops_iterators#recursion)
* [See Exercise 4](https://launchschool.com/books/ruby/read/loops_iterators#exercises)

### Arrays
```Arrays are an extremely valuable data set. They can be used to store many different kinds of data and you'll see them very often in the wild. Ruby's array class has lots of built-in methods that can be used to perform many of the daily functions that programmers use```
* [What is an Array?](https://launchschool.com/books/ruby/read/arrays#whatisanar)
* [Mutating the Caller](https://launchschool.com/books/ruby/read/arrays#mutatingthecallerthesequel)
* [How to compare Array?](https://launchschool.com/books/ruby/read/arrays#comparingarrays)
* [Common Array Methods]()
* [Hashes as Optional Parameters](https://launchschool.com/books/ruby/read/arrays#eachvsmap)
* [Ruby Version for Hash Order?](https://launchschool.com/books/ruby/read/hashes#anoteonhashorder)
* [See Exercise 4](https://launchschool.com/books/ruby/read/arrays#exercises)

### Hashes
```Now you have a good start at knowing all of the wonderful things that hashes can do. The concept of key-value pairs will come up quite often in other technologies as well, so it's good to have a tight grasp on it```
* [What is an Hash?](https://launchschool.com/books/ruby/read/hashes#whatisahash)
* [Hash vs Array?](https://launchschool.com/books/ruby/read/hashes#hashesvsarrays)
* [Common Hash Methods](https://launchschool.com/books/ruby/read/hashes#commonhashmethods)
