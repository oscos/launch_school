  Create a method that takes two integers as arguments. The first argument is a 
  count, and the second is the first number of a sequence that your method will 
  create. The method should return an Array that contains the same number of 
  elements as the count argument, while the values of each element will be 
  multiples of the starting number.

  You may assume that the count argument will always have a value of 0 or greater, 
  while the starting number can be any integer value. If the count is 0, an 
  empty list should be returned.

-----------------------INSTRUCTIONS------------------------------------

--------------------------PROBLEM--------------------------------------

Questions:

Input: 2 Integers as arguments

Output: Array of integers

---------------------------RULES---------------------------------------
Explicit: 
  given two integers as params
    - first number is a count 
    - second number represents the (second number..multiples of 2nd #..first number)
    - first number will always be 0 or greater
    - while the second number can be any integer value
    - if first number is 0 return empty array
Implicit: 

EdgeCases:
  - first number is 0
  - second number is 0
  - second number is negative
  - second number is very large (times out)
  
--------------------------ALGORITHM------------------------------------
  given two numbers create a range of numbers by taking the second number 
  and adding multiples of it x number of times, where x represents the first number.


--------------------------EXAMPLES-------------------------------------



--------------------------PSEUDO CODE----------------------------------
 + create method that takes two integer parameters
 - take 1 upto(first number) and create a range multiplying second number 
  times each number in range.
  - save each return value of the iteration into an array

p sequence(3, 0) == [0, 0, 0]
p sequence(0, 1000000) == []
