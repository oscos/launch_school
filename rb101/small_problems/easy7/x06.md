=begin
  Modify the method from the previous exercise so it ignores non-alphabetic 
  characters when determining whether it should uppercase or lowercase each 
  letter. The non-alphabetic characters should still be included in the return 
  value; they just don't count when toggling the desired case.

-----------------------INSTRUCTIONS--------------------------------------

--------------------------PROBLEM----------------------------------------

Questions:

Input: String

Output: String

---------------------------RULES-----------------------------------------
Explicit: 
  - parse through string chars and upcase / downcase in succession
  - exclude non-alpha chars from succession count

Implicit: 

EdgeCases:


--------------------------Mental Model-----------------------------------
parse through string , and upcase / downcase chars in succession if they 
are alpha chars, ignore non-alpha chars in succession count but keep them
as part of final string that is returned.


--------------------------EXAMPLES---------------------------------------



----------------------------ALGO----------------------------------------
+ create method with string param
+ add letter_counter to keep track of alpha chars
+ convert all chars to downcase
+ convert string to array
+ parse through array and 
  if char is letter and succession index is odd upcase and increase letter counter
  else return char with  no modification
  NOTE: if using map, counter will need to go before upcasing as you will end up
        with numbers in array.  May want to use each with upcase! instead
