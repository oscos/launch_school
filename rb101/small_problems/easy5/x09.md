=begin
Write a method that takes a string argument and returns a new string that contains 
the value of the original string with all consecutive duplicate characters 
collapsed into a single character. You may not use String#squeeze or String#squeeze!.
=end

Problem:
  - Input: string
  - Output: String with duplicate characters removed keeping only one
  - RulesRequirements: 
    + Explicit: 
      - Do not use String#squeeze
      - duplicate string of characters must be consecutive
      - remove duplicate characters keeping only 1 of those characters
      
    + Emplicit:
      - string may contain duplicates or may not
    + EdgeCases:
      - string may be empty
  - MentalModel:
      - create a method that takes one string parameter and removes any characters that are 
        next to each other if they are duplicates. Return clean string 
Example:
    - see below
  
DataStructure
  - String 
  - Array
Algo
  - create method with string parameter
  - add gaurd clause if str is empty return empty string
  - create a empty String `var`
  - iterate through each element in string and compare current element with previous element
  - if current element is first element add to `var`
  - if current element is not first elmement and not the same as previous element then add to 'var'
  - if current element is the same as the previous element skip adding element to `var`
  - return str var when all iteration is complete
