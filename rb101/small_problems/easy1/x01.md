# PEDAC

## Process the Problem
```ruby
Write a method that takes two arguments, a string and a positive integer, and 
prints the string as many times as the integer indicates.
```

### Understand the Problem
1. Expected input
    - String parameter str
    - Integer parameter x
2. Expected output
    - String str printed x number of times
3. Make Requirements/Rules Explicit
    - positive integer
    - non-empty string
4. Clarifying Questions
    - What are the extremes, limits on both ends
        - added gaurd clause for less than 1
    - What to do about nil or empty value or 0
        - add gaurd clause for empty string and 0

5. Mental model of the problem (optional)
    - write a method that takes two parameters, one string and one integer. The method should print the string str a set number of times defined by int x.

### Examples/Test Case 
1. Validate understanding of the problem
    ```ruby
    Hello
    Hello
    Hello
    ```
### Data Structure 
1. How we represent data that we will work with when converting the input to output.
    - string, number 
    - (loop method)

### Algorithm 
1. Steps for converting input to output
    - create method repeat that accepts 2 parameters (string, int)
    - print the string int number of times
2. Further exploration
    - try writing the method using a loop instead.

### Code with Intent 
1. Code Implementation of Algorithm
