  The Fibonacci series is a series of numbers (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...) 
  such that the first 2 numbers are 1 by definition, and each subsequent number 
  is the sum of the two previous numbers. This series appears throughout the 
  natural world.
  
  Computationally, the Fibonacci series is a very simple series, but the results 
  grow at an incredibly rapid rate. For example, the 100th Fibonacci number is 
  354,224,848,179,261,915,075 -- that's enormous, especially considering that it 
  takes 6 iterations before it generates the first 2 digit number.
  
  Write a method that calculates and returns the index of the first Fibonacci 
  number that has the number of digits specified as an argument. 
  
  (The first Fibonacci number has index 1.)

--------------------------PROBLEM----------------------------------------

Questions:

Input: Number

Output: Number

---------------------------RULES-----------------------------------------
Explicit: 
  - given number calculate and return the INDEX
    of first fib number that has the same amount of digits as the method parameter
  - first fib number has index 1 (index 1 based)
Implicit: 

EdgeCases:


--------------------------Mental Model-----------------------------------
given number, use it to find the fibonacci sequence that has the same number of elements
as given number.


--------------------------EXAMPLES---------------------------------------
if n = 3 then find the first fib number with 3 digits


----------------------------ALGO----------------------------------------
- find fibonacci number run fibonacci calculation
- iterate through fibonacci calc
- save the return value of each iteration into an array
- stop when the first number in array has the same digits as the parameter
- return the index of that number (note index count start at 1)
