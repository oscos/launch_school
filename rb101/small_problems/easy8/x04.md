=begin

  Write a method that returns a list of all substrings of a string. The returned 
  list should be ordered by where in the string the substring begins. This means 
  that all substrings that start at position 0 should come first, then all 
  substrings that start at position 1, and so on. Since multiple substrings will 
  occur at each position, the substrings at a given position should be returned 
  in order from shortest to longest.

  You may (and should) use the leading_substrings method you wrote in the 
  previous exercise:
