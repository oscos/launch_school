  and the second is the ending number. Print out all numbers between the two 
  numbers, except if a number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz", if a number is 
  divisible by 5, print "Buzz", and finally if a number is divisible by 3 and 5, 
  print "FizzBuzz".

Output: Print numbers and strings

---------------------------RULES---------------------------------------
Explicit: 
  - given two numbers
  - print out range of numbers between input params unless :
    - divisible by 3 & 5 - print "FizzBuzz"
    - divisible by 3 = print "Fizz"
    - divisible by 5 = print "Buzz:

EdgeCases:


--------------------------ALGORITHM------------------------------------
given two numbers as params print out range of numbers, substitue the words
"FizzBuzz", Fizz, Buzz if numbers are divisible by 3 &5, 3, and 5

--------------------------PSEUDO CODE----------------------------------
create method that takes 2 numbers
find range between numbers and iterate
if current number is divisible by 3 && 5 print "FizzBuzz"
elsif current nubmer is divisibly by 3 print "Fizz"
elseif current number is divisible by 5 print "Buzz"
else print number
