  Write a method that takes an Array of numbers, and returns an Array with the 
  same number of elements, and each element has the running total from the 
  original Array.

Problem
  Input: Array
  Output: Array
  Rules:
    Explicit:
      - given array of ints return
      - return array of same number of ints converted into running totals
      
    Implicit:
      - array can be empty return empty array
      - array can have only one int, return int
      
    EdgeCases:
   MentalModel: 
      - given array as input traverse through the array and add the current number plus 
        previous number for each number
Example:
  
DataStructure:
  - Number
  - Array
    


Algorithm:

  - create method with Array param
  - iterate through each of the elements
  - for each current element add the previous number to the current element
    - initialize total variable = 0
    - initialize variable results = []
    - add total += current_element 
    - move new total to results array
    - reassing total = total
    - return array with same number of elements but the numbers converted to running totals.
