In the modern era under the Gregorian Calendar, leap years occur in every year 
that is evenly divisible by 4, unless the year is also divisible by 100. If the 
year is evenly divisible by 100, then it is not a leap year unless the year is 
evenly divisible by 400.

Assume this rule is good for any year greater than year 0. Write a method that 
takes any year greater than 0 as input, and returns true if the year is a leap 
year, or false if it is not a leap year.
