  Write a method that searches for all multiples of 3 or 5 that lie between 1 
  and some other number, and then computes the sum of those multiples. For 
  instance, if the supplied number is 20, the result should be 
  98 (3 + 5 + 6 + 9 + 10 + 12 + 15 + 18 + 20).

  You may assume that the number passed in is an integer greater than 1.

PEDAC

Problem:
  Input: Integer parameter Int
  Output: Integer - Calculated Sum of Array of Numbers
  Rules/Requirements:
    Explicit: 
      - find range 1..Int
      - calculate sum of multiples of 3, 5 in range
      - parameter is positive int greater than 1
    Implicit: 
      - 
    Edge Cases:

  Mental Model:
      - given number Int, find range between 1 and Int, then extract
        multiples of 3 or 5 within range and add them up.  
Example:
  - Given Int = 10 
  - the range [1.2,3,4,5,6,7.8.9.10]
  - the multiples are [3,5,6,9,10]
  - the sum is 33
  
DataStructure: Integers, Arrays

Algorithm:
  - define method with one parameter Int
  - Initialize var to a collection containing the numbers 1..int
  - iterate through array and filter numbers that are divisible by 3 or 5
  - sum the filter collection.
