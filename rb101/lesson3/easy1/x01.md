Question 1
What would you expect the code below to print out?

numbers = [1, 2, 2, 3]
numbers.uniq

puts numbers

Answer: 
=> [1, 2, 2, 3]

Explanations:
Since the uniq method is non-mutating, calling puts on the number variable
does not change the `numbers array` nor the elements of the array. To do so, 
you would need to call `numbers.uniq`  
Note that calling puts on numbers.uniq will ouput [1, 2, 3]
