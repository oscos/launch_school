# Given array, what do the following method calls do?

### Exercise 1a:
```ruby
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
numbers.delete_at(1)  
```

> Return Value: 2

> Concept: Mutating the caller

Explanation: 
1. The variable `numbers` is initialized and bounded to an array object with a value of [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
2. The `delete_at` method with `parameter 1` is called on the `numbers` variable, resulting in the deletion of the array element at `index 1` which in this case is 2.
3. Because the `delete_at` method is destructive, the array object to which `numbers` is bounded to is now modified (`mutated`). This means `numbers` still points to the same object_id but the elements inside of the array have been altered.

### Exercise 1b:
```ruby
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
numbers.delete(1)  
```

> Return value: 1

> Concept: Mutating the caller

Explanation: 
1. The variable `numbers` is initialized and bounded to an array object with a value of [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
2. The `delete` method with `parameter 1` is called on the `numbers` variable, resulting in the deletion of the array element witha value of `1`.
3. Because the `delete` method is destructive, the array object to which `numbers` is bounded to is now modified (`mutated`). This means `numbers` still points to the same object_id but the elements inside of the array have been altered.
