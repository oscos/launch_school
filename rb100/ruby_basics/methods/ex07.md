# Naming Animals
Fix the following code so that the names are printed as expected.

Problem:
```ruby
def dog
  return name
end

def cat(name)
  return name
end

puts "The dog's name is #{dog('Spot')}."
puts "The cat's name is #{cat}."
```

Expected Output:
```ruby
The dog's name is Spot.
The cat's name is Ginger.
```

Solution:
```ruby
def dog(name)
	return name
end
  
def cat(name)
	return name
end
  
puts "The dog's name is #{dog('Spot')}."
puts "The cat's name is #{cat('Spot')}."
```
