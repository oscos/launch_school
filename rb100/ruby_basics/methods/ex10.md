# Random Sentence
Write a method that accepts one argument, but doesn't require it. The parameter 
should default to the string "Bob" if no argument is given. The method's return 
value should be the value of the argument. The code should output true twice.

Problem:
```ruby
puts add(2, 2) == 4
puts add(5, 4) == 9
puts multiply(add(2, 2), add(5, 4)) == 36
```

Solution:
```ruby
def name(names)
  names.sample
end

def activity(activities)
  activities.sample
end

def sentence(name,activity)
  "#{name} went #{activity} today!"
end

names = ['Dave', 'Sally', 'George', 'Jessica']
activities = ['walking', 'running', 'cycling']

puts name(names)
puts activity(activities)

puts sentence(name(names), activity(activities))
```
