# Name Not Found
Write a method that accepts one argument, but doesn't require it. The parameter 
should default to the string "Bob" if no argument is given. The method's return 
value should be the value of the argument. The code should output true twice.

Problem:
```ruby
puts assign_name('Kevin') == 'Kevin'
puts assign_name == 'Bob'
```

Solution:
```ruby
def assign_name(parameter_one='Bob')
  parameter_one
end

puts assign_name('Kevin') == 'Kevin'
puts assign_name == 'Bob'
```

Explanation: 
The method assign_name is given a default parameter value on line 1.  By setting 
the method parameter equal to a value, we prevent the program from erroring out 
when a no argumetn is passed to a method.  Line 2 simply lists the parameter
allowing the method to return the value that has been passed to it.  On line 5,
a value of `Kevin` is passed to the assin_name method and the return value is
compared against the string `kevin`, which in this case returns true.  On line 6,
no value is passed in to the method.  However the method defaults value is returned,
which in this case is equal to `Bob`, which also causes the statement to return true.  

Key Points:
1. Default values in a method allow your program not to break in the event the
user does not provide a value.
2. You can compare the return value of a method to a string all on the same line.
