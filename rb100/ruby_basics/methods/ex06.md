# Day or Night?

The variable below will be randomly assigned as true or false. Write a method 
named time_of_day that, given a boolean as an argument, prints "It's daytime!" 
if the boolean is true and "It's nighttime!" if it's false. Pass daylight into 
the method as the argument to determine whether it's day or night.

```ruby
daylight = [true, false].sample
```

Solution:
```ruby
def time_of_day(parameter1)
    if parameter1
        puts "it's daytime!"
    else
        puts "It's nighttime!"
    end
end

daylight = [true, false].sample
    
time_of_day(daylight)
```

Explanation: 

Key Points:
1. Booleans can be passed in as arguments.
2. sample methods can be passed on to variables.
