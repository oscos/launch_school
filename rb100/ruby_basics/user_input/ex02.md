# Your Age in Months

Write a program that asks the user for their age in years, and then converts 
that age to months.

Examples:
```ruby
$ ruby age.rb
>> What is your age in years?
35
You are 420 months old.
```

Solution:
```ruby
def calculate_months(years_old)
  total_months = years_old * 12
  puts "You are #{total_months} months old"
end

puts "What's your age in years"
variable_a = gets.chomp.to_i

calculate_months(variable_a)
```

Explanation: 
User is asked to enter their age in years. User input is converted to integer. 
The input value is assigned to `variable_a` and passed in as an argument when 
the `calculate_month` method is invoked. Once invoked, the calculate_months method
receives the value as a parameter where it's used to calculate the total number
of months.

Key Points:
1. When user input needs to be used in calculation, use `to_i` to convert to integer.
2. You can use string interpolation to combine variables and string texts in the 
same line.
