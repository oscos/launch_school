# Opposites Attract
Write a program that requests two integers from the user, adds them together, 
and then displays the result. Furthermore, insist that one of the integers be 
positive, and one negative; however, the order in which the two integers are 
entered does not matter.

Do not check for the positive/negative requirement until both integers are 
entered, and start over if the requirement is not met.

You may use the following method to validate input integers:

```ruby
def valid_number?(number_string)
  number_string.to_i.to_s == number_string && number_string.to_i != 0
end
```

Example:
```ruby
$ ruby opposites.rb
>> Please enter a positive or negative integer:
8
>> Please enter a positive or negative integer:
0
>> Invalid input. Only non-zero integers are allowed.
>> Please enter a positive or negative integer:
-5
8 + -5 = 3

$ ruby opposites.rb
>> Please enter a positive or negative integer:
8
>> Please enter a positive or negative integer:
5
>> Sorry. One integer must be positive, one must be negative.
>> Please start over.
>> Please enter a positive or negative integer:
-7
>> Please enter a positive or negative integer:
5
-7 + 5 = -2
```


Solution:
```ruby
def valid_number?(number_string)
  number_string.to_i.to_s == number_string && number_string.to_i != 0
end

loop do

	puts ">> Please enter a positive or negative integer:"
	num1 = gets.chomp
	
	puts ">> Please enter a positive or negative integer:"
	num2 = gets.chomp

	if (num1.to_i * num2.to_i) > 0
		puts ">> Sorry. One integer must be positive, one must be negative? "
		puts ">>Please start over!"
	elsif (valid_number?(num1) && valid_number?(num2))
		result = num1.to_i + num2.to_i
		puts "#{num1} + #{num2} = #{result}"
		break
	else  
		puts ">> Invalid input. Only non-zero integers are allowed."
	end	

end  
```
