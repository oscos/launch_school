# User Name and Password
In the previous exercise, you wrote a program to solicit a password. In this 
exercise, you should modify the program so it also requires a user name. The 
program should solicit both the user name and the password, then validate both, 
and issue a generic error message if one or both are incorrect; the error message 
should not tell the user which item is incorrect.

Examples:
```ruby
$ ruby login.rb
>> Please enter user name:
John
>> Please enter your password:
Hello
>> Authorization failed!
>> Please enter user name:
mary
>> Please enter your password:
SecreT
>> Authorization failed!
>> Please enter user name:
admin
>> Please enter your password:
root
>> Authorization failed!
>> Please enter user name:
admin
>> Please enter your password:
SecreT
Welcome!
```

Solution:
```ruby
USERNAME = 'Jackson'
PASSWORD = 'AbcEasyAs123'

input_pass = nil
input_user = nil

loop do
  puts ">> Please enter your user name: "
  input_user = gets.chomp
  break if input_user == USERNAME
  puts "Authorization failed!"
end

loop do
  puts ">> Please enter your password: "
  input_pass = gets.chomp
  break if input_pass == PASSWORD
  puts "Authorization failed!"
end

puts "Welcome!"
```

Explanation: 
After constant is initialized, a loop compares its value to the `user_input`
value. if it's a match, we exit the loop and prints the welcome message.

Key Points:
1. Pay attention to variable scope.
