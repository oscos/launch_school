# Passwords
Write a program that displays a welcome message, but only after the user enters 
the correct password, where the password is a string that is defined as a 
constant in your program. Keep asking for the password until the user enters 
the correct password.

Examples:
```ruby
$ ruby password.rb
>> Please enter your password:
Hello
>> Invalid password!
>> Please enter your password:
Secret
>> Invalid password!
>> Please enter your password:
SecreT
Welcome!
```

Solution:
```ruby
PASSWORD = 'AbcEasyAs123'

loop do
  puts ">> Please enter your passord: "
  user_input = gets.chomp
  break if user_input == PASSWORD
  puts "Invalid password!"
end

puts "Welcome!"
```

Explanation: 
After constant is initialized, a loop compares its value to the `user_input`
value. if it's a match, we exit the loop and prints the welcome message.

Key Points:
1. A constant is variable with all capital letters.
