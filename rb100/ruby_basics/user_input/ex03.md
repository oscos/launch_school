# Print Something (Part 1)

Write a program that asks the user whether they want the program to print 
"something", then print it if the user enters y. Otherwise, print nothing.

Examples:
```ruby
$ ruby something.rb
>> Do you want me to print something? (y/n)
y
something

$ ruby something.rb
>> Do you want me to print something? (y/n)
n

$ ruby something.rb
>> Do you want me to print something? (y/n)
help
```

Solution:
```ruby
puts "Do you want this program to print something? Enter `y` for yes."
user_input = gets.chomp.downcase

if user_input == 'y'
  puts "something"
end
```

Explanation: 
`Puts` prints out the message to the user screen. At which point it is captures
by the local variable `user_input`.  The answer is converted to lowercase useing
`downcase` method to help with matching process.  Finally an `if condition statement`
checks if the `user_input` value matches `y`.  If it matches, the message is printed
otherwise the program ends without any further messaging.


Key Points:
1. Use downcase to help match user response to necessary criteria.
2. Use if statement to check if user input matches desired result.
