# Launch School Printer (Part 2)
In an earlier exercise, you wrote a program that prints 'Launch School is the 
best!' repeatedly until a certain number of lines have been printed. Our solution 
looked like this:

Problem:
```ruby
while number_of_lines > 0
  puts '>> How many output lines do you want? Enter a number >= 3:'
  number_of_lines = gets.to_i

  if number_of_lines < 3
  puts ">> That's not enough lines."

  puts 'Launch School is the best!'
  number_of_lines -= 1
end
```

Modify this program so it repeats itself after each input/print iteration, 
asking for a new number each time through. The program should keep running 
until the user enters q or Q.

Example:
```ruby
$ ruby lsprint2.rb
>> How many output lines do you want? Enter a number >= 3 (Q to quit):
5
Launch School is the best!
Launch School is the best!
Launch School is the best!
Launch School is the best!
Launch School is the best!
>> How many output lines do you want? Enter a number >= 3 (Q to quit):
2
>> That's not enough lines.
>> How many output lines do you want? Enter a number >= 3 (Q to quit):
3
Launch School is the best!
Launch School is the best!
Launch School is the best!
>> How many output lines do you want? Enter a number >= 3 (Q to quit):
q
```

Solution:
```ruby
loop do

  user_string = nil
  user_number = nil

  loop do
    puts ">> How many output lines do you want? Enter a number >= 3 (Q to quit):"
    
    user_string = gets.chomp.downcase
    user_number = user_string.to_i
    
    break if user_string == 'q'
    
    break if user_number >= 3
    puts ">> That's not enough lines."
    
  end
  
  break if user_string == 'q'
  
  loop do
    puts "Launch School is the best!"
    user_number -= 1
    break if user_number == 0
  end

end 
```

Explanation:
Our solution requires an outer loop to control the repetition of the input and 
output processes. We also need to change how inputs are handled since we can 
have both numeric and alphabetic (q or Q) inputs, and must account for both.

We store the actual input string in input_string, get rid of the newline, and 
convert it to lowercase. We then break out of the inner loop if input_string is 
a q. The rest of the inner loop is just like our original program: we convert 
the input to a number, and ensure the value is at least 3.

Our inner loop is followed by a second break if input_string == 'q' to break out 
of the outer loop if the user quit. This is necessary since a break inside a 
loop always exits the innermost containing loop, so the break in the inner loop 
can't exit the outer loop.

Key Points:
1. User input can only be captured once with `gets.chomp`. In order to establish
a second variable using the `gets.chomp` value, we need to reference the first 
variable and play on it `input_number.to_i = input_string`.
