# Launch School Printer (Part 2)
In an earlier exercise, you wrote a program that prints 'Launch School is the 
best!' repeatedly until a certain number of lines have been printed. Our solution 
looked like this:

Problem:
```ruby
while number_of_lines > 0
  puts '>> How many output lines do you want? Enter a number >= 3:'
  number_of_lines = gets.to_i

  if number_of_lines < 3
  puts ">> That's not enough lines."

  puts 'Launch School is the best!'
  number_of_lines -= 1
end
```

Modify this program so it repeats itself after each input/print iteration, 
asking for a new number each time through. The program should keep running 
until the user enters q or Q.

Example:
```ruby
$ ruby lsprint2.rb
>> How many output lines do you want? Enter a number >= 3 (Q to quit):
5
Launch School is the best!
Launch School is the best!
Launch School is the best!
Launch School is the best!
Launch School is the best!
>> How many output lines do you want? Enter a number >= 3 (Q to quit):
2
>> That's not enough lines.
>> How many output lines do you want? Enter a number >= 3 (Q to quit):
3
Launch School is the best!
Launch School is the best!
Launch School is the best!
>> How many output lines do you want? Enter a number >= 3 (Q to quit):
q
```

```ruby

def run_lines(number)
  while number > 0 do
    puts("Launch School is the best!")
    number -= 1
  end
end

loop do
  puts("How many output lines do you want? Enter a number >= 3 (Q to quit):")
  num = gets.chomp
  
  break if num.downcase == 'q'
  
  if num.to_i >= 3
    run_lines(num.to_i)
  else
    puts ">> That's not enough lines."
  end  
end 
```

Solution 1 (Answered On 06/13/2020):
```ruby
loop do

  user_string = nil
  user_number = nil

  loop do
    puts ">> How many output lines do you want? Enter a number >= 3 (Q to quit):"
    
    user_string = gets.chomp.downcase
    user_number = user_string.to_i
    
    break if user_string == 'q'
    
    break if user_number >= 3
    puts ">> That's not enough lines."
    
  end
  
  break if user_string == 'q'
  
  loop do
    puts "Launch School is the best!"
    user_number -= 1
    break if user_number == 0
  end

end 
```

Key Points:
1. User input can only be captured once with `gets.chomp`. In order to establish
a second variable using the `gets.chomp` value, we need to reference the first 
variable and play on it `input_number.to_i = input_string`.

## Process the Problem
    
### Understand the Problem
1. Expected input 
  - String representation of number (Number of lines)
  - String (q or Q)
2. Expected output
  - String (Launch School is the best)
3. Make Requirements/Rules Explicit
  - 
  - 
4. Clarifying Questions
    - What are the extremes, limits on both ends
    - What to do about nil or empty value or 0

5. Mental model of the problem (optional)


### Examples/Test Case 
1. Validate understanding of the problem

### Data Structure 
1. How we represent data that we will work with when converting the input to output.

### Algorithm 
1. Steps for converting input to output

### Code with Intent 
1. Code Implementation of Algorithm
