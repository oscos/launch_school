# Dividing Numbers
Write a program that obtains two Integers from the user, then prints the results 
of dividing the first by the second. The second number must not be 0, and both 
numbers should be validated using this method:

Problem:
```ruby
def valid_number?(number_string)
  number_string.to_i.to_s == number_string
end
```

This method returns true if the input string can be converted to an Integer and 
back to a string without loss of information, false otherwise. It's not a perfect 
solution in that some inputs that are otherwise valid (such as 003) will fail, 
but it is sufficient for this exercise.

Example:
```ruby
$ ruby division.rb
>> Please enter the numerator:
8
>> Please enter the denominator:
2
>> 8 / 2 is 4

$ ruby division.rb
>> Please enter the numerator:
8.3
>> Invalid input. Only integers are allowed.
>> Please enter the numerator:
9
>> Please enter the denominator:
4
>> 9 / 4 is 2


$ ruby division.rb
>> Please enter the numerator:
10
>> Please enter the denominator:
a
>> Invalid input. Only integers are allowed.
>> Please enter the denominator:
0
>> Invalid input. A denominator of 0 is not allowed.
>> Please enter the denominator:
5
>> 10 / 5 is 2
```

Solution 1(Answered On: 06/13/2020):
```ruby
def valid_number?(number_string)
  number_string.to_i.to_s == number_string
end

numerator = nil
denominator = nil
result =  nil

loop do
  puts ">> Please enter the numerator:"
  numerator = gets.chomp  
  
  if valid_number?(numerator)
    break
  else
    puts ">> Invalid input. Only integers are allowed."
  end
end

loop do
  puts ">> Please enter the denominator:"
  denominator = gets.chomp
  
  if !valid_number?(denominator)
    puts ">> Invalid input. Only integers are allowed."
  elsif denominator == '0' 
    puts ">> Invalid input. A denominator of 0 is not allowed."
  else
    break
  end 
  
end

# puts "Success!"
result = numerator.to_i / denominator.to_i

puts "#{numerator} / #{denominator} is #{result}"
```

Solution 2(Answered On: 09/08/2020):
```ruby
def valid_number?(number_string)
  number_string.to_i.to_s == number_string
end

loop do
    puts(">> Please enter the numerator:")
    numerator = gets.chomp
    puts(">> Please enter the denominator:")
    denominator = gets.chomp

    if !(valid_number?(numerator) && valid_number?(denominator)) #!(False && False) == True
      puts(">> Invalid input. Only integers are allowed.")
      next
    elsif (denominator.to_i == 0)
      puts(">> Invalid input. A denominator of 0 is not allowed.")
      next
    else
      result = (numerator.to_i / denominator.to_i)
      puts(">> #{numerator} / #{denominator} is #{result}")
      break
    end
end

```

# PEDAC

## Process the Problem
    
### Understand the Problem
1. Expected input 
    - integers
2. Expected output
    - boolean
3. Make Requirements/Rules Explicit
    - method with two parameters
    - return error, if second number == 0
    - both numbers must be validated using given method `valid_number?` 
      which returns boolean

4. Clarifying Questions
    - What are the extremes, limits on both ends
        - What to do about negative numbers -> process them.
    - What to do about nil or empty value or 0
        - return error

5. Mental model of the problem (optional)
    - write method that accepts two number as parameters.  Both numbers must 
      be validated using the given method `valid_number?` which returns boolean. if method returns true for both numbers, and denominator is not equal to zero divide the first number by the second number. Otherwise return error.

### Examples/Test Case 
1. Validate understanding of the problem
    - input(4,2) => 2
    - input(2,4) => 0.25
    - input(0,4) => 0
    - input(0,4) => error, loop again.

### Data Structure 
1. How we represent data that we will work with when converting the input to output.
    - Integer
    - Boolean
    - String

### Algorithm 
1. Steps for converting input to output
    - create loop do and place code inside
    - puts question asking for first number
    - capture response in variable numerator
    - puts quetion asking for second number 
    - capture response in denominator
    - send both variables to `valid_number?` method
    - if return value for `valid_number?` method is:
      - false, then puts error message to re-enter numbers.
      - true, check if denominator is greater than zero
          - if false, puts error message 2nd number must be greater than zero
          - if true, divide numberator by denominator and puts message that includes result.
