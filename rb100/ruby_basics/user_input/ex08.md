# Dividing Numbers
Write a program that obtains two Integers from the user, then prints the results 
of dividing the first by the second. The second number must not be 0, and both 
numbers should be validated using this method:

Problem:
```ruby
def valid_number?(number_string)
  number_string.to_i.to_s == number_string
end
```

This method returns true if the input string can be converted to an Integer and 
back to a string without loss of information, false otherwise. It's not a perfect 
solution in that some inputs that are otherwise valid (such as 003) will fail, 
but it is sufficient for this exercise.

Example:
```ruby
$ ruby division.rb
>> Please enter the numerator:
8
>> Please enter the denominator:
2
>> 8 / 2 is 4

$ ruby division.rb
>> Please enter the numerator:
8.3
>> Invalid input. Only integers are allowed.
>> Please enter the numerator:
9
>> Please enter the denominator:
4
>> 9 / 4 is 2


$ ruby division.rb
>> Please enter the numerator:
10
>> Please enter the denominator:
a
>> Invalid input. Only integers are allowed.
>> Please enter the denominator:
0
>> Invalid input. A denominator of 0 is not allowed.
>> Please enter the denominator:
5
>> 10 / 5 is 2
```

Solution:
```ruby
def valid_number?(number_string)
  number_string.to_i.to_s == number_string
end

numerator = nil
denominator = nil
result =  nil

loop do
  puts ">> Please enter the numerator:"
  numerator = gets.chomp  
  
  if valid_number?(numerator)
    break
  else
    puts ">> Invalid input. Only integers are allowed."
  end
end

loop do
  puts ">> Please enter the denominator:"
  denominator = gets.chomp
  
  if !valid_number?(denominator)
    puts ">> Invalid input. Only integers are allowed."
  elsif denominator == '0' 
    puts ">> Invalid input. A denominator of 0 is not allowed."
  else
    break
  end 
  
end

# puts "Success!"
result = numerator.to_i / denominator.to_i

puts "#{numerator} / #{denominator} is #{result}"
```

Explanation: 

In this exercise, we solicit two pieces of independent information, so we need 
separate loops for each number. The first should look reasonably familiar by now, 
but the second is a bit more complex due to the additional requirement that the 
denominator not be 0. There are a number of different ways to do this; we just 
chose a way that we feel is reasonably clear.

In our last two lines, we convert the two inputs to integers, divide them, and 
then print the result. Note that we are doing integer division, so 9 / 4 is 2, 
not 2.25.
