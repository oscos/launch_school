# Launch School Printer (Part 1)
Write a program that prints 'Launch School is the best!' repeatedly until a 
certain number of lines have been printed. The program should obtain the number 
of lines from the user, and should insist that at least 3 lines are printed.

For now, just use #to_i to convert the input value to an Integer, and check that 
result instead of trying to insist on a valid number; validation of numeric 
input is a topic with a fair number of edge conditions that are beyond the 
scope of this exercise.


Examples:
```ruby
$ ruby lsprint.rb
>> How many output lines do you want? Enter a number >= 3:
5
Launch School is the best!
Launch School is the best!
Launch School is the best!
Launch School is the best!
Launch School is the best!

$ ruby lsprint.rb
>> How many output lines do you want? Enter a number >= 3:
2
>> That's not enough lines.
>> How many output lines do you want? Enter a number >= 3:
3
Launch School is the best!
Launch School is the best!
Launch School is the best!
```

Solution:
```ruby
user_input = nil

loop do
  puts ">> How many output lines do you want? Enter a number >= 3:"
  user_input = gets.chomp.to_i  
  break if user_input >= 3
  puts ">> That's not enough lines."  
end
  
loop do
  puts "Launch School is the best!"
  user_input -= 1
  break if user_input == 0
end
```

Explanation: 
We start of by declaring the varialbe `user_input` and setting it to nil. This 
allows us to use that variable in multiple loop statements. Validation is added
in the first loop to ensure the number is greater than 3. Once the value passes
validation, the program runs the second loop where it iterates equal to the 
number value of `user_input` variable

Key Points:
1. You can define multiple loops in order to satisfy different conditions.  
2. Only after the first loop is ran does the program move onto the next piece
of code.
3. In order to avoid having to write multiple pieces of code, a variable can be
initialized outside the loop and manipulated as needed inside each of the loops.
