# Large Numbers

Using the ruby documentation, determine how you can write large numbers in 
a way that makes them easier to read.

Answer: 

Ruby provides different syntax to help with the readability of large numbers.  
One example is the underscore.  Since Ruby will convert commas within a number 
to array items, here is one way to write 9,876,543 using the underscore instead:

```ruby
9_876_543

```
