# Where to Find Documentation

Where can you find the most complete Ruby documentation?

Answer: 

Here are two links: 
1. [Ruby-Docs.org](https://ruby-doc.org/)
2. [Docs-Ruby-Lang.org/en](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/)

Documentation is split into two API sections with links to each Ruby versions:

1. Core API - Contains base classes and modules that are used more often 
and therefore are automatcially imported and available to users in both 
IRB and ruby scripts.

2. Standard Library API - Contains standard classes and modules that are
used less often and therefor need to be imported by callig them explicity 
using the **Required** command.
