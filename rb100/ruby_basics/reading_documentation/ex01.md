# Where to Find Documentation

Where can you find the most complete Ruby documentation?

Answer: 

Here are two links: 
1. [Ruby-Docs.org](https://ruby-doc.org/)
2. [Docs-Ruby-Lang.org/en](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/) # (Preferred choice by LS)

Documentation is split into two API sections with links to each Ruby versions:

1. Core API - Contains base classes and modules that are used more often 
and therefore are automatcially imported and available to users in both 
IRB and ruby scripts.

2. Standard Library API - Contains standard classes and modules that are
used less often and therefor need to be imported by callig them explicity 
using the **Required** command.


I personally like the to use both.  In my opionin, [Ruby-Docs.org](https://ruby-doc.org/) has a
nicer layout. It's easier to distinguish between Core API's and Standard Libraries 
by version.
That said, [Docs-Ruby-Lang.org/en](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/) makes it easier 
to locate items, which is probably why Launch School now recommeds it's use over it's
previous recommendation.  

For the most part it looks like the content is almost identical which probably
means they are under the same organization perhaps.   See the while loop as 
an example between the two:


1. [Ruby-Docs.org#while-loop](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.1/doc/syntax/control_expressions_rdoc.html#label-while+Loop)

vs

2. [Docs-Ruby-Lang.org/en#while-loop](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/2.7.0/syntax/control_expressions_rdoc.html#label-while+Loop)
