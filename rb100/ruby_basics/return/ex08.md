# Counting Sheep (Part 2)

What will the following code print? Why? Don't run it until you've attempted 
to answer.

```ruby
def count_sheep
  5.times do |sheep|
    puts sheep
  end
  10
end

puts count_sheep
```


Solution:
```ruby
0
1
2
3
4
# 5  #times returns this value however the method does not return it since it's not the last line.
10
```

Explanation: 

#times method starts at 0 and prints until 4. Although 5 is also returned by #time method,
because 10 is the last line, it is returned instead.

Key Points:
1. #times returns the initial integer.
