# Breakfast, Lunch, or Dinner? (Part 4)

What will the following code print? Why? Don't run it until you've attempted 
to answer.

```ruby
def meal
  puts 'Dinner'
  return 'Breakfast'
end

puts meal
```


Solution:
```ruby
`Dinner`
'Breakfast'
```

Explanation: 

This method contains both a `puts` string and a `explicit return statement`.
When the method is called, `Dinner` is printed to the screen due to the `puts`
In addition the `explicit return statement` will return the string `Breakfast`
Because we call the method using `puts`, the evaluated value of the return
statement also prints.

Key Points:
1. `Return statemetents` always return the evaluated result of the last line of 
the expression unless an explicit return comes before it.
2. `Return statements` can be implicit (not typed out), or explicit (typed out)
3. When return is executed, it immediately exits the method.  Anything after it 
will not be processed.
4. `puts` in a method prints the value but always returns `nil`. `return`.
