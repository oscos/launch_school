# Breakfast, Lunch, or Dinner? (Part 1)

What will the following code print? Why? Don't run it until you've attempted 
to answer.

```ruby
def meal
  return 'Breakfast'
end

puts meal
```


Solution:
```ruby
'Breakfast'
```

Explanation: 

A method always returns the last line tha is executed within it, whether or not 
a `return statement` is explicitly stated. Since in this case there is only one 
line, the string `Breakfast is returned

Key Points:
1. `Return statemetents` always return the evaluated result of the last line of 
the expression unless an explicit return comes before it.
2. `Return statements` can be implicit (not typed out), or explicit (typed out)
3. When return is executed, it immediately exits the method. Anything after will
not be processed.
