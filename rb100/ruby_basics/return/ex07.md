# Counting Sheep (Part 1)

What will the following code print? Why? Don't run it until you've attempted 
to answer.

```ruby
def count_sheep
  5.times do |sheep|
    puts sheep
  end
end

puts count_sheep
```


Solution:
```ruby
0
1
2
3
4
5
```

Explanation: 

#times method starts at 0 and therefore only prints until 4.  However because
the method returns the number declared, 5 shows up in the print statuement

Key Points:
1. #times returns the initial integer.
