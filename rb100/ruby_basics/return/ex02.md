# Breakfast, Lunch, or Dinner? (Part 2)

What will the following code print? Why? Don't run it until you've attempted 
to answer.

```ruby
def meal
  'Evening'
end

puts meal
```


Solution:
```ruby
'Evening'
```

Explanation: 
A method always returns the last line tha is executed within it, whether or not 
a `return statement` is explicitly stated. Since in this case there is only one 
line, the string `Evening` is returned

Key Points:
1. `Return statemetents` always return the evaluated result of the last line of the expression unless an explicit return comes before it.
2. `Return statements` can be implicit (not typed out), or explicit (typed out)
3. When return is executed, it immediately exits the method
