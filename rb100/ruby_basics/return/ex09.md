# Counting Sheep (Part 3)

What will the following code print? Why? Don't run it until you've attempted 
to answer.

```ruby
def count_sheep
  5.times do |sheep|
    puts sheep
    if sheep >= 2
      return
    end
  end
end

p count_sheep
```


Solution:
```ruby
0
1
2
nil
```

Explanation: 

#times method starts at 0 and prints until 5. In this case a condition has been added
to exit the method once 2 has been reached.  Because an explicit return has been declared
without anything provided to the return, the method returns nil.

Key Points:
1. #times returns the initial integer.
2. when return is explicitly stated, you must provide a value.
