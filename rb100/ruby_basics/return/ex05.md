# Breakfast, Lunch, or Dinner? (Part 5)

What will the following code print? Why? Don't run it until you've attempted 
to answer.

```ruby
def meal
	'Dinner'
	puts 'Dinner'
end
  
p meal
```


Solution:
```ruby
`Dinner`
nil
```

Explanation: 

In this exercise, the last line in the `meal method` will print out `Dinner` but
return `nil`. This is because `puts` always returns `nil` in a method if it's the 
last line.  Following the method, the `meal method` is invoked with a `p`.  This 
is usually done to print the `nil` result value of a method.

Remaining Questions: 
1. What happens to the first line inside the method `Dinner`. Is it ignored?
2. Why didn't the method print out 2 `Dinner`

Key Points:
1. `Return statemetents` always return the evaluated result of the last line of 
the expression unless an explicit return comes before it.
2. `Return statements` can be implicit (not typed out), or explicit (typed out)
3. When return is executed, it immediately exits the method.  Anything after it 
will not be processed.
4. `puts` in a method prints the value but always returns `nil`. `return`.
5. Use `p` to print the result in a method even if that result is `nil`.
