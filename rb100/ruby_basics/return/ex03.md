# Breakfast, Lunch, or Dinner? (Part 3)

What will the following code print? Why? Don't run it until you've attempted 
to answer.

```ruby
def meal
  return 'Breakfast'
  'Dinner'
end

puts meal
```


Solution:
```ruby
'Breakfast'
```

Explanation: 

A method always returns the last line tha is executed within it, whether or not 
a `return statement` is explicitly stated. In this case, a `return statement`
was explicitly stated which causes the program to exit the method immediately,
ignoring the last line `Dinner` in the code.

Key Points:
1. `Return statemetents` always return the evaluated result of the last line of 
the expression unless an explicit return comes before it.
2. `Return statements` can be implicit (not typed out), or explicit (typed out)
3. When return is executed, it immediately exits the method.  Anything after it 
will not be processed.
