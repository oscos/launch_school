# What's My Value? (Part 4)

What will the following code print and why? Don't run it until you have 
tried to answer.

```ruby
a = "Xyzzy"

def my_value(b)
  b[2] = '-'
end

my_value(a)
puts a
```
Output: Xy-zy

Explanation: 

Because the string value of the object assigned to `variable a` outside the method 
was mutated, the result of `puts a` outputs `Xy-zy`.

Key Points: 

1. Ruby objects with a string value are mutatable. 
2. Operations inside methods like `String#[]=` are destructive and mutate the caller.
3. It's possible for variables with different names to refer to the same object_id's 
and output the same values if the method is destructive.
