# That's Odd

The code below shows an example of a for loop. Modify the code so that it only outputs 
i if i is an odd number.

```ruby
for i in 1..100
  puts i if i % 2 != 0
  # alternate solution: puts i if i.odd?
end
```


Explanation: 
Within the for loop method, you can add a condition that divides the number and
checks the remainder to determine if it is an odd or even number. Alternatively 
we could have used the odd? method.


Key Points: 
1. You can use a modulus operator to filter odd or even numbers..
