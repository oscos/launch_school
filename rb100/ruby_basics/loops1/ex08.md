# Print Until

Given the array of several numbers below, use an until loop to print each number.

```ruby
numbers = [7, 9, 13, 25, 18]
```

Expected output:
```ruby
7
9
13
25
18
```

Answer: 
```ruby
x = 0

until x == numbers.size
    puts numbers[x]
    x += 1
end
```

Explanation: 
In order to print out the values in the `numbers array` in ascending order, we use
the `+= operator`.  the `local vriable x` is initialized to zero to be used as a 
counter.  As the until loop runs, it increases the value to `until the counter equals
the size of the array designated by `numbers.size` method .


Key Points: 
1. The `numbers.size` method returns the size of the array as an integer value.
2. numbers[x] returns the position of a specific value in an array.
