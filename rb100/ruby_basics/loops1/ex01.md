# Runaway Loop

The code below is an example of an infinite loop. The name describes exactly 
what it does: loop infinitely. This loop isn't useful in a real program, 
though. Modify the code so the loop stops after the first iteration.

```ruby
loop do
  puts 'Just keep printing...'
  break # this line added to exit out of loop.
end
```

Explanation: 
By adding the keyword `break` will allow us to exit a loop.

Key Points: 
1. The reserve keyword `break` will allow us to exit a loop and back to the
program code. 
2. Within the loop, any code following the `break` statement will no
longer execute.
3. The focus is placed back into the program and any code outside of the loop 
will continue to execute as normal.
