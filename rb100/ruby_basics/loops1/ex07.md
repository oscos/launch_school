# Count Up

The following code outputs a countdown from 10 to 1. Modify the code so 
that it counts from 1 to 10 instead.

```ruby
count = 1

until count == 11
  puts count
  count += 1
end
```

Explanation: 
To count up it is necessary to start the counter at 1 and use the `+= operator`
instead of the `-= operator`.  The until loop condition on line 3 needs to be
reach 10 to stop therefore 11 is used as the max value.


Key Points: 
1. += operator adds one to the counter in a loop.  
2. the condition in count in this example is set to one more from the value we need.
