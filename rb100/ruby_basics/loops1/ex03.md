# Control the Loop

Modify the following loop so it iterates 5 times instead of just once.

```ruby
iterations = 1

loop do
  puts "Number of iterations = #{iterations}"
  iterations += 1
  
  if iterations == 6
    break
  end
end
```

Explanation: 
Because a loop is a method definition with a block, we are able to use the 
initilized variable, `iterations` within the method without declaring it inside
the method. We increment the the counter `iterations` by one each time the 
variable re-enters the loop. Upon reaching 6 we break out of the loop permanently.

Key Points: 
1. The reserve keyword `break` will allow us to exit a loop and back to the
program code. 
2. Within the loop, any code following the `break` statement will no
longer execute, unless the `break` is on the same line as the condition statement.
3. The focus is placed back into the program and any code outside of the loop 
will continue to execute as normal.
4. A loop will most likely always contain some kind of counter or condition statement.
