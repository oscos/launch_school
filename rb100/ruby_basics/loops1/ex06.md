# Print While

Using a while loop, print 5 random numbers between 0 and 99. The code below 
shows an example of how to begin solving this exercise.

```ruby
numbers = []

while numbers.size < 5
  numbers << rand(100)
end

puts numbers
```

Explanation: 

Note: I was able to solve this with a `for loop` however, I had no idea how to solve
it using a `while loop`.  Below is a description of the LS solution.

Line 1 starts by declaring and initilizing an empty array labeled `numbers`.
Line 3 contains a `while loop` that checks for the size of the `numbers array` with a
a constraint limiting the size of the array to less than 5.  It's important to remember
that arrays start at zero by default.  
Line 4 contains the rand() method which generates random numbers.  It also contains the 
shovel method `<<` which appends new results to the end of the list in an array. 

Finally puts numbers outputs the results of the array.

Key Points: 
1. Arrays start at zero by default.
2. Arrays can be initialized as empty and populated throughout the program.
3. Array.size will return the number of items in an array.
4. The shovel method `<<` appends results to the end of an list in an array.
5. rand() method generates random numbers.
