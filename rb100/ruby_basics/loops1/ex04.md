# Loop on Command

Modify the code below so the loop stops iterating when the user inputs 'yes'.

```ruby
loop do
  puts 'Should I stop looping?'
  answer = gets.chomp.downcase
  break if answer == "yes"
  puts "enter the word 'yes' to stop loop."
end
```

Explanation: 
We are using the input from the user to determine if the condition has been met.
If it has not, continue looping until it has.  Because the word `yes` in the condition
is case sensitive, we convert it to lower case to reduce the checkpoints. Lastly,
because break is part of the same line in the if statement, the puts below executes.
Had the break been inside the if end statement, the break would have had to be below 
the puts statement.

Key Points: 
1. The reserve keyword `break` will allow us to exit a loop and back to the
program code. 
2. Within the loop, any code following the `break` statement will no
longer execute, unless the `break` is on the same line as the condition statement.
3. The focus is placed back into the program and any code outside of the loop 
will continue to execute as normal.
4. A loop will most likely always contain some kind of counter or condition statement.
