# Loopception

The code below is an example of a nested loop. Both loops currently loop 
infinitely. Modify the code so each loop stops after the first iteration.

```ruby
loop do
  puts 'This is the outer loop.'

  loop do
    puts 'This is the inner loop.'
  end
end

puts 'This is outside all loops.'
```

Explanation: 
By adding the keyword `break` will allow us to exit a loop.

Key Points: 
1. The reserve keyword `break` will allow us to exit a loop and back to the
program code. 
2. Within the loop, any code following the `break` statement will no
longer execute.
3. The focus is placed back into the program and any code outside of the loop 
will continue to execute as normal.
