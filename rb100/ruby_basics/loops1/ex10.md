# Greet Your Friends

Your friends just showed up! Given the following array of names, use a for loop 
to greet each friend individually.

```ruby
friends = ['Sarah', 'John', 'Hannah', 'Dave']
```

Expected output:

```ruby
Hello, Sarah!
Hello, John!
Hello, Hannah!
Hello, Dave!
```

for friend in friends
   puts "Welcome #{friend}!"
end


Explanation:
Using the singular format of the `array name friends`, we iterate through
each of the itmes in the array.  We then use the `string interpolation operator #{}`
to return back the value of each item along with the greeting.


Key Points: 
1. Use for loop to iterate over a set number of elements.
2. String interpolation operator to concatenate string with variables
