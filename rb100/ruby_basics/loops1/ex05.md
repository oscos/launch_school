# Say Hello

Modify the code below so "Hello!" is printed 5 times.

```ruby
say_hello = true
i = 0

while say_hello
  puts 'Hello!'
  i += 1
  say_hello = false if i == 5  
end
```

Explanation: 

In this exercise we use a while loop to demonstrate how to use boolean values as parameters
to establish condtions within a loop. The local variable `say_hello` is initialized to true.  
We add `local variable i` as a counter variable and initialize it to zero.  The `say_hello` 
variable is passed in as a parameter into the while loop which evaluates to the boolean 
expression of true. This causes the loop to continue to execute until the condition inside 
the loop evaluates to the boolean expression of false. This happens when the `local variable i` 
which increments each time by 1 reaches 5.  


Key Points: 
1. This demonstrates boolean values as parameters in a loop.
