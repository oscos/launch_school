# Large Numbers

Using the ruby documentation, determine how you can write large numbers in 
a way that makes them easier to read.

Per the Ruby documentation for [Numbers](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.5.1/doc/syntax/literals_rdoc.html#label-Numbers)
which is found under [Literals](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.5.1/doc/syntax/literals_rdoc.html#label-Literals)

>The underscore may be used to enhance readability for humans. 
>You may place an underscore anywhere in the number

What this means is the following:

1. You can use an underscore instead of comma to seperate a large number.

In place of commas, you can write 9,876,543 as follow:

```
9_876_543

```

In addition to the underscore there is additonal syntax within the 
[Numbers](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.5.1/doc/syntax/literals_rdoc.html#label-Numbers) 
which you can use for better number readability.
