# Optional Arguments

Assume you have the following code:

```ruby
s = 'abc def ghi,jkl mno pqr,stu vwx yz'
puts s.split.inspect # Exercise A
puts s.split(',').inspect # Exercise B
puts s.split(',', 2).inspect # Exercise C
```
What will each of the 3 puts statements print?

Answer(s): 

Excercise A:
```ruby
["abc", "def", "ghi,jkl", "mno", "pqr,stu", "vwx", "yz"]
```

Excercise B:
```ruby
["abc def ghi", "jkl mno pqr", "stu vwx yz"]
```

Excercise C:
```ruby
["abc def ghi", "jkl mno pqr,stu vwx yz"]
```

Similaritities: 
1. All 3 exercises contain the 
[#split](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.0/String.html#method-i-split) 
instance method which dvides the string "s" into substrings, which in these 
three exercises are delimited by either whitespaces or commas, and return 
a new array object.
2. All 3 problems contain the 
[#inspect](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.0/String.html#method-i-inspect) 
instance method which returns a string representation of the array object
that was created by the split instance method.
3. s.split is the same as calling s.split(' ') but not s.split('') nor s.split('   ')
4. "puts s.split.inspect" outputs the same result as "p s.split" 

Differences:
1. Exercise A - uses whitespace as the delimmeter
2. Exercise B - Uses comma as the delimmeter
3. Exercise C - Uses comma as the delimmiter, with a rule limitting the number
of strings returned to 2
