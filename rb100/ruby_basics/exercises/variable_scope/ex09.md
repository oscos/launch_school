# What's My Value? (Part 9)

What will the following code print and why? Don't run it until you have 
tried to answer.

```ruby
a = 7
array = [1, 2, 3]

array.each do |a|
  a += 1
end

puts a
```
Output: 7

Explanation: 

In this exercise, there are two variables sharing the same name `a`.  
The first `variable a` that is initialized on line 1 is an `instance variable`.
The second `variable a` on line 4 is a `local variable` to the array#each method.  
Normally a methodinvocation with a block has access to the `instance variable` 
initilized outside the method.  However because a `local variable a` has been 
declared within the method invocation with a block, it shadows the 
`instance variable a` initializedon line 1.  Thus `puts a` on line 8 which 
bypasses the `local variable a` inside the block and refers back to the 
`instance variable a` on line 1.


Key Points: 

1. Method invoication with a block is different than method definition
2. A variable outside a method has a different scope than a variable inside 
a method. Therefor it's possible to share the same variable name and refer to 
different object_id's and output different values if the method is non-destructive.
3. This exercise introduces shadowing.
