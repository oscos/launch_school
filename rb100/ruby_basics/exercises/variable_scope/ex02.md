# What's My Value? (Part 2)

What will the following code print and why? Don't run it until you have 
tried to answer.

```ruby
a = 7

def my_value(a)
  a += 10
end

my_value(a)
puts a
```
Output: 7

Explanation: 

Because the numeric value of the object assigned to `variable a` outside the method 
does not change, the result of `puts a` outputs 7.  The exercise might be confusing 
to the student because the variable name inside and outside the method share the 
same variable name.

Key Points: 

1. Ruby objects with a numeric value are immutable. 
2. Assignment operators `+=` inside a method are non-destructive which means they 
do not do not mutate the caller but instead create new objects.
3. A variable outside a method has a different scope than a variable inside 
a method. Therefor it's possible to share the same variable name and refer to 
different object_id's and output different values if the method is non-destructive.
