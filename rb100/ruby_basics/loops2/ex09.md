# Only Even
The following code increments number_a and number_b by either 0 or 1. loop is 
used so that the variables can be incremented more than once, however, break 
stops the loop after the first iteration. Use next to modify the code so that 
the loop iterates until either number_a or number_b equals 5. Print "5 was 
reached!" before breaking out of the loop.

Problem:
```ruby
number_a = 0
number_b = 0

loop do
  number_a += rand(2)
  number_b += rand(2)

  break
end
```

Solution:
```ruby
number_a = 0
number_b = 0

loop do
  number_a += rand(2)
  number_b += rand(2)

  next unless (number_a == 5 || number_b == 5)
  puts "5 was reached!"
  break
  
  # if (number_a == 5 || number_b == 5)
  #   puts "5 was reached! -- #{number_a} -- #{number_b}"
  #   break
  # end

end
```

Explanation: 
Using the `unless` condition along with `next`, we add logic to our loop to skip
to the next value untill our condition is true. Once the condition is set to true
the next line of code iterates which in this case prints out the desired statement
before finally breaking out of the loop.


Key Points:
1. `Next` is similar to `Break` in that you can place if condition on same line.
2. It's important to note the location of where `next` is placed as placing it 
to early in your code may have unexpected results.
3. You can alternatively use `unless` instead of `if` along with `next`.
