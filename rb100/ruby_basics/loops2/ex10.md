# Greeting
Given the code below, use a while loop to print "Hello!" twice.

Problem:
```ruby
def greeting
  puts 'Hello!'
end

number_of_greetings = 2
```

Solution:
```ruby
def greeting
  puts 'Hello!'
end

number_of_greetings = 2

while number_of_greetings > 0 # do
  greeting
  number_of_greetings -= 1
end
```

Explanation: 
Using a whle loop, a check constraint is placed at the very begining of the loop.
The greeting method is then called which prints out `Hello`.  The counter,
number_of_greetings is reduced by one and the loop runs again before finally
satisfying the condition when number_of_greetings equals 0.


Key Points:
1. You can call a method simply by placing the method name inside your loop
2. The while loop places the check constraint before any code is executed where
as the do loop places executes the code at least once before checking the 
constraint.
3. No `break` statement is necessary.
