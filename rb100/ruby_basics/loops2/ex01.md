# Even or Odd?

Write a loop that prints numbers 1-5 and whether the number is even or odd. 
Use the code below to get started.


```ruby
count = 1

loop do
   if count.even?
       puts "#{count} is even!"
   else
       puts "#{count} is odd!"
   end
   
   count += 1   
   break if count > 5  
end
```

Explanation: 
An if statement has been added to check if the count value is an odd or even number and
prints a message accordingly.  The counter is then increase by one.  Finally a break
has been added which activates when the counter value goes above five.

Key Points:
1. There is both an odd and even method in ruby.
2. string interpolation makes it easy to combine variables and strings together.
3. break statements can have condtions.
