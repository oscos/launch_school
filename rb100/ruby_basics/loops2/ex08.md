# Only Even
Using next, modify the code below so that it only prints even numbers.

Problem:
```ruby
number = 0

until number == 10
  number += 1
  puts number
end
```

Solution:
```ruby
until number == 10
  number += 1
    next if number.odd?
    puts number
end
```

Explanation: 
The `next statement` which functions similar to the `break statement` in that
you can put if condition on the same line. A condition is added that checks to
see if the new value is odd and if so, skips over the next value.

Key Points:
1. `Next` is similar to `Break` in that you can place if condition on same line.
2. It's important to note the location of where `next` is placed as placing it 
to early in your code may have unexpected results.
