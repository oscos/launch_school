# Conditional Loop
Using an if/else statement, run a loop that prints "The loop was processed!" one time 
if process_the_loop equals true. Print "The loop wasn't processed!" if process_the_loop 
equals false.

```ruby
process_the_loop = [true, false].sample
```

Solution:
```ruby
if process_the_loop
   loop do
      puts "The loop was processed!"
      break
   end
else
   puts "The loop wasn't processed!"
end
```

Explanation: 


Key Points:
Using the array#sample method, we randomly pick between itme values in the array.
Using a do loop with a break statement we set the loop to either true or false and
depending on the result we print one of two put statements.  A break is added to the
first part of the condition in order to ensure the code runs only once.
