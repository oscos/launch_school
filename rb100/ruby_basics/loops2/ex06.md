# Get the Sum
Given the array below, use loop to remove and print each name. Stop the loop 
once names doesn't contain any more elements.  Keep in mind to only use loop, 
not while, until, etc.

```ruby
names = ['Sally', 'Joe', 'Lisa', 'Henry','Oscar']
```

Solution:
```ruby
  puts "Hello, #{names.shift}!" # first to last
  # puts names.pop # last to first
  break if names.empty?
```

Explanation: 
Using the Array#shift method within a loop allows you to iterate one item at a
time from first to last.  Using Array#pop does the same thing from last to first.
The Array#empty condition allows us to break when all of the items have been 
removed from the array.


Key Points:
1. Use Array#shift to return the first value of an array
2. Use Array#pop to return the last value of an array
3. Use Array#empty to check if an array is empty.
4. Note that array#pop(n-integer) is very different as it removes n-integer itmes
from an array in one iteration.
