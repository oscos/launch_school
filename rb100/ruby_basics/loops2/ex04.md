# Get the Sum
The code below asks the user "What does 2 + 2 equal?" and uses #gets to retrieve 
the user's answer. Modify the code so "That's correct!" is printed and the loop 
stops when the user's answer equals 4. Print "Wrong answer. Try again!" if the 
user's answer doesn't equal 4.

```ruby
loop do
  puts 'What does 2 + 2 equal?'
  answer = gets.chomp.to_i
end
```

Solution:
```ruby
loop do
  puts 'What does 2 + 2 equal?'
  answer = gets.chomp.to_i

   if answer == 4
      puts "That's correct!"  
      break
   else 
      puts "Wrong answer. Try again!"
   end
end
```
