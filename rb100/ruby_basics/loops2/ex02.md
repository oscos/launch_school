# Catch the Number

Modify the following code so that the loop stops if number is equal to or between 0 and 10.


```ruby
loop do
  number = rand(100)
  puts number
end
```

Solution:
```ruby
loop do
  number = rand(100)
  puts number
  break if number.between?(0,10)
end
```

Explanation: 
The loop uses the rand method to print random values from 1 to 99.
A break statemetn was added that uses the between method to check if
the random number generated is between 0 and 10 and when condition is
true, it stops the code.

Key Points:
1. Use rand method to generate random numbers
2. Use break statement to break out of loop.  
3. Use between method to compare values
