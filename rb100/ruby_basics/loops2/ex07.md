# Get the Sum
The method below counts from 0 to 4. Modify the block so that it prints the 
current number and stops iterating when the current number equals 2.

Problem:
```ruby
5.times do |index|
  # ...
end
```

Solution:
```ruby
5.times do |index|
  puts index
  break if index == 2
end
```

Explanation: 
The loop iterates 5 times starting from 0. This would print the values
0,1,2,3,4.  However because a condition has been added to stop when the value is
two, only three results are returned [0,1,2].

Key Points:
1. the `times` method counts from 0 to one less than the specified number
2. Remember that array indexes start at 0.
